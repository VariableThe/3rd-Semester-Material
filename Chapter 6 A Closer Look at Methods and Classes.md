### In-depth Study Material for Chapter 6: A Closer Look at Methods and Classes

#### Access Control in Java

- **Concept:** Access control in Java governs the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. It determines which parts of your code can interact with other parts, enhancing security and maintainability.
    
- **Access Specifiers:** Java uses four main access specifiers to manage access:
    
    - **`public`:** Members declared `public` are accessible from anywhere.
    - **`private`:** Members declared `private` are only accessible within the same class.
    - **`protected`:** Members declared `protected` are accessible within the same package and by subclasses in other packages.
    - **Default (package-private):** When no access specifier is used, the member has default access, meaning it's accessible within the same package but not from outside the package.
- **Access Control Table ():**
    
    | Specifier | Class | Package | Subclass | World | | :----------- | :---- | :------ | :------- | :----- | | **`private`** | Yes | No | No | No | | **Default** | Yes | Yes | No | No | | **`protected`** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | | **`public`** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
    
- **Example ():**
    
    ```java
    class Test {
        int a; // Default access
        public int b; // Public access
        private int c; // Private access
    
        void setc(int i) {
            c = i;
        }
    
        int getc() {
            return c;
        }
    }
    
    public class AccessTest {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            Test ob = new Test();
            ob.a = 10; // OK (same package)
            ob.b = 20; // OK (public)
            // ob.c = 100;  // Error! (private)
    
            ob.setc(100); // OK
            System.out.println("a, b, and c: " + ob.a + " " + ob.b + " " + ob.getc());
        }
    }
    ```
    
    In this example:
    
    - `a` can be accessed from within the same package.
    - `b` can be accessed from anywhere.
    - `c` can only be accessed within the `Test` class, using the public methods `setc()` and `getc()`.

#### Parameter Passing in Java

- **Call-by-Value:** Java uses call-by-value to pass arguments to methods. This means that a copy of the argument's value is passed to the method. If the argument is a primitive type, the method receives a copy of the primitive value. If the argument is a reference type, the method receives a copy of the reference, but both the original reference and the copy refer to the same object in memory.
    
- **Consequences:**
    
    - Changes to primitive type parameters inside a method do not affect the original argument.
    - Changes to the state of an object referenced by a reference type parameter inside a method do affect the original object. This is because both references point to the same object in memory ().
- **Example ():**
    
    ```java
    class Test {
        int a, b;
    
        Test(int i, int j) {
            a = i;
            b = j;
        }
    
        void meth(Test o) {
            o.a *= 2;
            o.b /= 2;
        }
    }
    
    class CallByValue {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            Test ob = new Test(15, 20);
            System.out.println("ob.a and ob.b before call: " + ob.a + " " + ob.b);
    
            ob.meth(ob);
    
            System.out.println("ob.a and ob.b after call: " + ob.a + " " + ob.b);
        }
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, the `meth()` method modifies the `a` and `b` values of the `Test` object `ob` because it receives a copy of the reference to `ob`. Both the original reference in `main()` and the copy in `meth()` refer to the same object.
    

#### Method Overloading ()

- **Concept:** Method overloading allows you to define multiple methods within the same class that have the same name but different parameter lists.
    
- **Rules:**
    
    - Overloaded methods must differ in the number and/or types of their parameters.
    - The return type of an overloaded method can be the same or different, but the return type alone is not sufficient to distinguish between overloaded methods.
- **Advantages:**
    
    - Provides flexibility in how you call methods, allowing you to use the same method name for different variations of an operation.
    - Improves code readability by using a single method name for related tasks.
- **Example ():**
    
    ```java
    class Overload {
        void test() {
            System.out.println("No parameters");
        }
    
        void test(int a) {
            System.out.println("a: " + a);
        }
    
        void test(int a, int b) {
            System.out.println("a and b: " + a + " " + b);
        }
    
        double test(double a) {
            System.out.println("double a: " + a);
            return a * a;
        }
    }
    
    class OverloadDemo {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            Overload ob = new Overload();
            double result;
    
            ob.test();
            ob.test(10);
            ob.test(10, 20);
            result = ob.test(123.25);
            System.out.println("Result of ob.test(123.25): " + result);
        }
    }
    ```
    
    This example demonstrates how you can overload the `test()` method with different parameter types and numbers.
    

#### Constructor Overloading ()

- **Concept:** Similar to method overloading, constructor overloading allows you to define multiple constructors for a class, each with a different parameter list.
    
- **Purpose:** Constructor overloading provides different ways to initialize objects of a class, offering flexibility in object creation.
    
- **Example ():**
    
    ```java
    class Overload {
        int data;
    
        Overload(int x) {
            data = x;
        }
    
        Overload(int x, int y) {
            data = x + y;
        }
    }
    ```
    
    This code shows two constructors for the `Overload` class: one takes a single integer to initialize `data`, and the other takes two integers and initializes `data` with their sum.
    

#### Returning Objects from Methods ()

- **Concept:** Methods in Java can return values of any data type, including objects (instances of classes). This allows methods to create and return new objects or to return existing objects.
    
- **Example ():**
    
    ```java
    class Test {
        int a;
    
        Test(int i) {
            a = i;
        }
    
        Test incrByTen() {
            Test temp = new Test(a + 10);
            return temp;
        }
    }
    
    class RetOb {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            Test ob1 = new Test(2);
            Test ob2;
    
            ob2 = ob1.incrByTen();
            System.out.println("ob1.a: " + ob1.a); // Output: ob1.a: 2
            System.out.println("ob2.a: " + ob2.a); // Output: ob2.a: 12
        }
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, the `incrByTen()` method creates a new `Test` object with its `a` value increased by 10 and then returns this new object.
    

#### Static Members: Variables, Methods, and Blocks ()

- **Static Variables (Class Variables):**
    
    - Belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class.
    - Shared by all instances of the class.
    - Declared using the `static` keyword.
- **Static Methods (Class Methods):**
    
    - Can be called without creating an instance of the class.
    - Can only access static data members.
    - Declared using the `static` keyword.
- **Static Blocks:**
    
    - Blocks of code that are executed exactly once when the class is first loaded.
    - Used to initialize static variables or perform other one-time setup tasks.
- **Example ():**
    
    ```java
    class UseStatic {
        static int a = 3;
        static int b;
    
        static void meth(int x) {
            System.out.println("x = " + x);
            System.out.println("a = " + a);
            System.out.println("b = " + b);
        }
    
        // Static block to initialize 'b'
        static {
            System.out.println("Static block initialized.");
            b = a * 4;
        }
    
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            meth(42);
        }
    }
    ```
    
    - Output:
        
        ```java
        Static block initialized.
        x = 42
        a = 3
        b = 12
        ```
        
    - Explanation:
        
        - When the `UseStatic` class is loaded, `a` is initialized to 3, then the static block executes, printing "Static block initialized" and setting `b` to 12.
        - When `main()` is called, it invokes the static method `meth()`.

#### Accessing Static Members ()

- **Within the Class:** Static members can be accessed directly by their name.
    
- **Outside the Class:** Static members are accessed using the class name followed by the dot operator (`.`) and the member name.
    
- **Example ():**
    
    ```java
    class StaticDemo {
        static int a = 42;
    
        static void callme() {
            System.out.println("a = " + a);
        }
    }
    
    class StaticByName {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            StaticDemo.callme(); // Calling a static method
            System.out.println("a = " + StaticDemo.a); // Accessing a static variable
        }
    }
    ```
    
    - Output:
        
        ```java
        a = 42
        a = 42
        ```
        

#### Inner (Nested) Classes ()

- **Concept:** A class that is defined within another class is called an inner class. Inner classes have access to the members of the enclosing class, even private members.
    
- **Types:**
    
    - **Member Inner Class:** Declared as a member of another class.
    - **Local Inner Class:** Defined within a block of code, such as a method.
    - **Anonymous Inner Class:** Declared and instantiated at the same time, often used for event handling and other short, specific tasks.
- **Example ():**
    
    ```java
    class Outer {
        int outer_x = 100;
    
        class Inner {
            void display() {
                System.out.println("display: outer_x = " + outer_x);
            }
        }
    }
    
    class InnerClassDemo {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            Outer outer = new Outer();
            Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
            inner.display();
        }
    }
    ```
    
    - Output:
        
        ```java
        display: outer_x = 100
        ```
        
    - Explanation: The `Inner` class can access the `outer_x` variable of the `Outer` class.
