### In-depth Study Material for Chapter 13: JavaFX

#### Introduction to JavaFX

JavaFX is a set of graphics and media packages that enables developers to create and deploy rich client applications. It provides a comprehensive API for building modern, visually appealing user interfaces.

#### Key Concepts in JavaFX

- **Stage and Scene:** The fundamental building blocks of a JavaFX application.
    - **Stage:** Represents the top-level container, typically a window, of a JavaFX application.
    - **Scene:** A container for all the visual elements (nodes) that make up the user interface of a JavaFX application.
- **Nodes and Scene Graphs:** Nodes are the individual visual elements that comprise a scene, such as buttons, text boxes, shapes, and images. These nodes are organized into a hierarchical structure known as a scene graph, where nodes can be parents or children of other nodes.
- **Anonymous Inner Classes:** JavaFX often utilizes anonymous inner classes, which are classes defined and instantiated at the same time, without explicitly giving them a name. They are commonly used to provide concise implementations for handling events associated with user interface components.

#### Anonymous Inner Classes

**Syntax:**

```java
// Test can be an interface, abstract/concrete class
Test t = new Test() {
    // Data members and methods
    public void test_method() {
        // ...
    }
};
```

**Example:**

```java
// Java program to demonstrate an anonymous inner class implementing an interface for a button
interface Age {
    int x = 21;
    void getAge();
}

class AnonymousDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Age oj1 = new Age() {
            public void getAge()   {
                System.out.print("Age is " + x);
            }
        };
        oj1.getAge();
    }
}
```

In this example, the anonymous inner class implements the `Age` interface, providing an implementation for the `getAge()` method.

#### Conclusion

This study material provided an overview of the core concepts of JavaFX, covering essential topics such as stages, scenes, nodes, and the use of anonymous inner classes in event handling. Understanding these fundamentals lays the groundwork for building interactive and visually engaging JavaFX applications.
